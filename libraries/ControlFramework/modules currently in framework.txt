Algorithms:
*Spd to Spd no feedback: For inputting speed and outputting speed without feedback. Open loop speed control.



Devices:
*DirectDiscreteHBridge: An h bridge made out of discrete components (not an IC), and the microcontroller lines directly
control it (no other devices in between them). Two inputs, N transistor 1 and N transistor 2. It's assumed the other 
two transistors will be P transistors so they don't need control lines to the microcontroller.
